# Current Progress - Today's Focus Persistence Feature

## Summary

Successfully implemented persistence for the "Set Today's Focus" feature that was previously resetting on page refresh.

## Problem Statement

- **Issue**: "Set Today's Focus" value was lost on page refresh
- **Requirements**:
  - Use local storage to persist the focus value
  - Tie focus to the current date
  - Reset focus when date changes
  - Follow specified workflow for implementation

## Solution Implemented

### Key Discovery

Found that `useTodayFocus` hook already existed with full date-based persistence logic, but the kanban-header component wasn't using it - it was using local state instead.

### Critical Bug Fixed

- **Location**: `/modules/hooks/use-today-focus.ts` line 42
- **Issue**: Used `useMemo(() => getTodayDateString(), [])` which cached the date on mount
- **Impact**: Would continue using yesterday's date if app stayed open past midnight
- **Fix**: Removed useMemo to recalculate date on every render

### Integration Changes

**File**: `/modules/components/trello/kanban-header.tsx`

- Added import: `import { useTodayFocus } from "@/hooks/use-today-focus";`
- Replaced: `const [todayFocus, setTodayFocus] = useState<string | null>(null);`
- With: `const [todayFocus, setTodayFocus] = useTodayFocus();`

## Features Now Working

-  Persists focus value on page refresh
-  Ties focus to the current date (format: `{"2025-08-29": "Complete the design system"}`)
-  Automatically resets when date changes
-  Cross-tab synchronization via storage events
-  Cleans up entries older than 7 days
-  SSR-safe implementation

## Files Modified

1. `/modules/hooks/use-today-focus.ts` - Fixed date caching bug
2. `/modules/components/trello/kanban-header.tsx` - Integrated persistence hook
